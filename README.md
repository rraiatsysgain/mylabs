## Overview

Faster software development has become a competitive advantage for companies. The automation of software development processes facilitates speed and consistency, which led to the rise for having a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD) pipelines. Jenkins is a very popular product among Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, which can automate all of the phases of CI and CD. You can host Jenkins on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize your build automation and scale your deployment as the needs of your software projects grow.

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist.

20. **oci setup config** also generated an API key. We will need to upload this API key into our OCI account for authentication of API calls. Switch to ssh session to compute instance, to display the conent of API key Enter command :

```
cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```

21. Hightlight and copy the content from ssh session. Switch to OCI Console, Click Human icon followe by your user name. In user details page Click **Add Public Key**. In the dialg box paste the public key content and Click **Add**.
